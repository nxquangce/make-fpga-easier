# Make FPGA easier

This project aims to help students develop embedded system applications on FPGAs in a way just like programming on MCUs.

We develop controllers/modules that help FPGA communicate/control modules (sensors, actuators) of embedded systems, make developers focus on their application logic, and work easier with these modules on FPGA.
